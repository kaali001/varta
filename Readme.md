It leverages Socket.io for signaling and enables smooth peer-to-peer video streaming between users. Whether you want to chat with strangers or friends, Varta offers an intuitive and seamless video calling experience.

# ❓ How It Works

  - When a user joins, they enter the lobby and wait for another user to connect.
  - Once two users connect, the server creates a room and initiates the offer-answer exchange using WebRTC.
  - The two peers exchange ICE candidates to establish a connection.
  - Users can see both self-video preview and peer video on the interface.
